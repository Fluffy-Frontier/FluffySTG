/*
	An execution is a multistage finishing ability that typically ends in the death and/or dismemberment of one helpless victim

	Executions can be interrupted by the user taking damage, or the victim escaping out of reach

	Executions happen in two main phases
		Aquisition:
			a victim is chosen and checked for validity
			The victim and attacker are moved closer together, if needed
			Often, the attacker will grab the victim

			Can be interrupted during this stage

		Stages
			After this a series of execution stage datums are executed, one by one
			One of them should be a finisher, which unlocks the rewards

	Rewards:
		Since they are high risk and flashy, performing executions is generally rewarded. The reward may be any (usually several) of the following:

		-Some bonus biomass is added to the marker
		-Signals watching the kill recieve some energy
		-The attacker is healed to some degree
		-The attacker gains some buff
		-Attacker's cooldowns are refreshed
		-Nearby crew take major sanity damage (in future)
