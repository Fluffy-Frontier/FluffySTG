# This file contains extra tests to run for specific BYOND versions.
# This is useful for making sure we maintain compatibility with both older and newer versions,
# while still having our main tests run on a guaranteed pinned version.

# Format is "version: map" or "version: map;max_required_client_version"
# Example:
# 500.1337: runtimestation
# 516.1638: runtimestation;516
# Lowest supported version
# NOVA EDIT - Original: 515.1627: runtimestation
515.1637: runtimestation
# Beta version
516.1648: runtimestation;516
