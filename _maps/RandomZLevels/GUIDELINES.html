        <tr><td colspan="2"><p>So, you want to make an away mission! They're a lot of fun to play, but they're a challenge to create.
To ensure a consistent standard of quality across away missions, following the guidelines (split into recommended and required)
is beneficial to ensure your PR is merged.</p>
<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a design document
<ul>
<li>This one is good because it lets you make a coherent thought of what you want your away mission to be, and for others to understand its purpose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't go alone
<ul>
<li>Away missions are hard work! Making a team of different specializations helps out massively with workload and speed of the project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Communicate with Maintainers
<ul>
<li>During the creation of your away mission, it is highly recommended you communicate with maintainers to ensure major changes do not have to be made when it's finished.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="design-requirements">Design Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Minimum average time to complete: 60 minutes
<ul>
<li>Bare minimum, it should take a team of 4-6 60 minutes to complete.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Design around 4-6 players
<ul>
<li>Skyrat's gateways use the Vanguard expedition team, which is usually 4 players, but it's best to account for up to 6.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not purely PvE
<ul>
<li>Design your gateway with more than just regular simplemobs in mind. Add puzzles, story, PVP, boss fights, etc. to spice up the gameplay instead of a slog of simplemobs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Loot should not be extreme
<ul>
<li>The gateway's loot should mostly be given in the purview of using it in the gateway itself (final boss loot and similar not withstanding).</li>
<li>Loot that's unusable outside the gateway is given more leeway.</li>
<li>Loot should not be the primary encouragement for someone to go through the gateway.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul></td></tr></table></main>
