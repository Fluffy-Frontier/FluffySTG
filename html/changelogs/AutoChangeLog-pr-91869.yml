  - qol: "Mail is now shipped every 10 minutes rather than every 5 minutes. The amount of mail remains unchanged (so you get 1 crate with 6 mail instead of 2 crates with 3 mail each)."
  - qol: "Mail is no longer shipped while the station is on red alert - mail held will be sent if the station returns to blue alert."
