changes:
  - bugfix: "Autolathes no longer have a scrollbar that sends you off the screen."
  - bugfix: "Exosuit fabricators' queue list & Techfab/Autolathe's left side (with the sections of printables) now have a scrollbar when the full list doesn't fit on the UI for 516 users. Techfab/Autolathe also now does this for the list of items too, instead of always having one."
