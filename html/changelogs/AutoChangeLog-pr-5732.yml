changes:
  - balance: "Cargo Consoles no longer let you bypass the Weapon Permit requirement for guns that have it, unless emagged. Broadbanding it or using internal cargo consoles no longer bypass this."
  - balance: "Departamental accounts no longer can buy weapons that need a permit from imports. (They can still buy things that dont need a permit though!) This is of course bypassed with an emagged console."
  - balance: "The Binyat can no longer be obtained from Cargo."
  - balance: "The Binyat now requires a tech based on combat implants to be produced."
  - balance: "The Binyat no longer affects the cargo consoles."
  - balance: "Miner vendors money get you half the money for the same amount of points!"
  - bugfix: "Exploit with the binyat allowing to dissasemble blacklisted consoles, emag them, and reassembling them was removed."
