changes:
  - bugfix: "Spraycan-painted clothing now displays correctly when worn by short-height characters (e.g., Settler); paint no longer disappears on the mob sprite."
  - code_imp: "Worn overlay coloration now uses named filters and recurses to child overlays, making it resilient to later filter changes (like height displacement)."
