changes:
  - rscadd: "Vaguely estimate what kinds of hearts and lungs people have from a variety of weird stethoscope noises! (Or just look it up on the pr, I won't judge.)"
  - rscadd: "Using analog diagnostic tools on eldritch organs from beyond the waking world or people whose hearts cause their skin to arc like a tesla coil is a bad idea. Examine people, ya goof."
  - rscadd: "You can see if someone has an actively damaging (read: contracted straight from the groaning hungry source) zombie infection by using a penlight. Act out highly emotional headshot hesitation scenes today!"
  - rscadd: "New Hemoanalytic Scanner (read: really shitty but roundstart printable chem scanner), which tells you all about someone's blood, and can also detect medicines in their bloodstream! Not toxins or miscellaneous reagents though."
  - refactor: "Refactored and added some penlight, stethoscope, and organ code. If shit is fucked, please report it on the github issue tracker ASAP."
  - bugfix: "X-Ray vision generically causes eyes to glow under penlight, not just specifically the mutation X-Ray vision."
  - bugfix: "Reflex Hammers now fit in medical storage items, IE. medbelts and medkits."
  - balance: "People with welding-eyes or similar will not have their pupils react to penlight examination."
