changes:
  - qol: "Bluespace Miners and Powerators are now available on the engineering cargo console request, allowing engineering to help cargo with effort of their own."
  - balance: "Civilian Power generators adjusted. The RTG now produces a 1 tile radiation with half chance, with their power being 12KW from 15KW. The Atomic Whisper was toned down in efficiency, its now thrice as much as the super pacman (formely six as much), produces twice the power of a pacman (so 20KW instead of 32KW per increment), and produces water vapor and helium at a 9 to 1 rate, at 400C, from room temperature helium at 5. Byproducts can still be sold of course, but it requires effort, that said, the atomic whisper does not produce radiation. Reduced their material cost a bit to reflect their nerf."
  - balance: "Powerators were nerfed and made engineering only. Values for their consumption were adjusted all over,  with each company having different maximuns of production, powerator efficiency, and taxes. With NT and Tarkon having high taxes and high energy rates but having a higher cap of power selling, while the syndicate and then dyne paying less taxes or needing less power, at the cost of capping how much they can sell, making it so the more effort involved the more credits per hour achievable. Details on the PR, but the powerators will give their stats on examine."
  - bugfix: "Fixed some powerator issues, notably their power not matching to what they were set and consuming, made them very customizable with VV and more intuitive to use by mappers and admins, players will also find their stats when examining instead of having to code dive for this information."
  - qol: "Powerator now automatically goes down to the power it has available instead of not processing. We are aware this could be a negative if the power is not constant, you might want to setup smes units in the middle."
  - rscadd: "The portable Gravity Generator, as well as minor tools packs, were made accesible by the public at large, instead of just restricted to Engineering."
  - code_imp: "Cleaned up the code for Powerators and made it single accounts, as the need for two accounts was removed. Can be reverted in the future with ease, but for now we save a couple process pass. Updated the Powerator to use proper TG procs to make it a lil bit more robust against the passage of time."
