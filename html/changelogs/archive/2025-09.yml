  - image: The Miecz has been restored back to its classic bullpup stick-mag form.
      Those who suggest that the Miecz was, actually, yet another iteration of a 618-year-old
      rifle design are clearly from people who need to get their brains checked by
      Medbay for plasma exposure and poisoning.
  - balance: .27-54 Cesarzowa is back to being more in-line with a pistol-caliber

  Stalkeros for the code, Hollandaise for the sprites, Golden Freddy for the flag design:
