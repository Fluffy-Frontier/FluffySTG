  - code_imp: Makes both the new and bitrunning vendor beacons to respect preferences,
      the beacons start without lushwish machines and only adds them when a user with
      such preferences enabled (and the server) has erp enabled. If you start with
      one spawned in your hand, drop it and grab it again for it to update!
