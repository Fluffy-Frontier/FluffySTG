  necromanceranne:
  - balance: Mechs are considerably more vulnerable to EMPs than they were previously.
  - balance: The tier of capacitor inside a mech will substantially improve a mech's
      defenses against EMP damage. Having only tier 1 capacitors will result in your
      mech rapidly destroyed from repeat EMPs.
  - balance: Mechs suffer more power loss from EMPs. It can take upwards of 8 heavy
      strength EMPs to deplete a mechs cell if it has a tier 4 capacitor. It takes
      only two if it has a tier 1.
  - balance: Mechs suffer more integrity loss from EMPs. A durand can withstand around
      8 heavy strength EMPs before being destroyed if it has a tier 4 capacitor. It
      won't survive more than two or three if it has a tier 1.

      with tracker beacons.

      to fall out naturally. Macroplastics launched straight into your body, as sponsored
      by the Donk Corporation.
  - bugfix: Weapons that cannot fit into turrets also cannot fit into emitters.
  - bugfix: The HoP's winter coat now uses the correct suit storage options (like
