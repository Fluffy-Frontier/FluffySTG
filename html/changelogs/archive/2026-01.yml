  - bugfix: Removes rogue decal from catwalk station
  FalloutFalcon:
  - bugfix: eyeless overlays with now display properly again
  - bugfix: Less abstract mobs will spawn in random spawners (mostly relating to the
      summoning prefix)
  - bugfix: '"Boss" basic mobs are now exluded from the summoning prefix to parody
      behavior of them being megafauna'
  - rscadd: water and saltwater can be scooped from water turfs
  - rscadd: mineral water (water with minor tox heal), scoop-able from hot-springs
  - refactor: behavior for scooping reagents from plasma turfs has been made generic
      and reusable

  - bugfix: Lattice now stop you from dipping into water
  Fghj240:
  - bugfix: Exosuit fabricator UI now shows the Savannah-Ivanov's supported equipment
  - qol: weapon rechargers don't wait an extra tick before announcing they've finished
      recharging
  - spellcheck: weapon rechargers no longer claim a battle rifle has "finished recharging"
      when it's finished recalibrating.
  - qol: Revolutionaires gain a positive moodlet instead of a negative one when they
      see a dead head of staff

  Ghommie:
  - refactor: Follow-up to the crafting/material refactor from months ago. All objects
      crafted with stacks now inherit their mat composition (not necessarily the effects
      and color) by default, while previously only a few things like chair, sinks
      and toilets did. Report any object looking or behaving weirdly as a result.
  - bugfix: The material composition of ammo boxes is no longer a 1/10 of what it's
      supposed to be. It was a shitty hack to make it harder to recycle empty ammo
      boxes. Instead, they lose materials as they're emptied now.
  Hatterhat:
  - rscadd: Energy shoulder holsters can now fit a power cell inside of them to act
      as a wearable recharger specifically for energy weapons. Examine them for more
      details, and remember to actually wear them to recharge your guns.

      you can now craft a one-slot, high-output energy shoulder holster.
  - bugfix: Security webbing's basic sprite now uses the TG basic sprite.
  - qol: Holsters now hold energy guns and laser guns just fine instead of specifically
      the mini e-gun, cap's laser, HoS laser, etc.
  - balance: Most holsters now only fit one gun, much like secbelts. Energy shoulder
      holsters, as befitting their plural nature, still hold two.
  - balance: Small guns and small batons no longer count against secbelts' limited
      slots for normal-size guns/batons. Not that you should have a secbelt full of
      snub-nose Renards instead of just carrying one and some speedloaders, but if
      you're going to drop a set of handcuffs for a backup pocket pistol, at least
      you can still stash your disabler.
  - balance: The Syndicate has realized that way too much funding was allocated to
      the Deep Space 2 program's armor-outfitting budget, and has subsequently field-executed
      those responsible for the record-breaking levels of embezzlement. Armor for
      DS2 has subsequently been realigned with regular Gorlex-Cybersun MODsuits. Affected
      parties are invited to file a complaint.
  - rscadd: All the laser guns from the recent upstream merge are now reflavored to
      be variants of the SC-1. The laser pistol was buffed, the burst carbine's capacity

  - bugfix: The disabler SMG and hybrid taser no longer have redundant indicators
      for self-charging.

      only to Nova maps)

  - qol: Silent jaws of recovery is now less obvious that it's modified
  Melbert:
  - qol: If you are within a disposal bin or chute, and drop an item, the item will
      go into the bin, rather than onto the floor outside of the bin.
  - balance: Tech storage access is no longer a "command level" access, meaning the
      HoP can give it to crewmembers that have a normal ID card. Note, secure tech
      storage still requires bridge access, which requires a silver ID card.
  - bugfix: Wall mounts no longer stick to tables instead of the wall behind it
  - rscadd: Compact defib can be worn and used on the suit storage slot of labcoats,
      surgical aprons, and medical MODsuits

      mechs please

  - image: '"Mantis Alt (Top)" is now a option to be picked at "Wings".'
  OrbisAnima:
  - rscadd: Added 3x3 beds.
  - rscadd: Added the missing facing side to double beds.

      in your hands when creating one.

      hand instead of your offhand

      deployed parts.
