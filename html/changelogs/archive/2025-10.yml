      (it still takes 10 seconds though, which is non-negligible).
  - balance: Spider effigies (the ones that look like Eris sprites) now check for
      ear protection when trying to inflict brain damage. Bowmans are sufficient to
      block the trauma infliction, at time of writing.
  - rscadd: Card shoes are now stocked in Good Clean Fun vendors, featuring a whopping

  - rscadd: Personality is now available in character preferences! Choose how your
      character reacts to the whims and woes of the station.

      Unless your personality says you don't, of course.
  - balance: Antag moodlets have been strengthened a bit to compensate for the murder
      they have to partake in.

      console request, allowing engineering to help cargo with effort of their own.
  - balance: Civilian Power generators adjusted. The RTG now produces a 1 tile radiation
      with half chance, with their power being 12KW from 15KW. The Atomic Whisper
      was toned down in efficiency, its now thrice as much as the super pacman (formely
      six as much), produces twice the power of a pacman (so 20KW instead of 32KW
      per increment), and produces water vapor and helium at a 9 to 1 rate, at 400C,
      from room temperature helium at 5. Byproducts can still be sold of course, but
      it requires effort, that said, the atomic whisper does not produce radiation.
      Reduced their material cost a bit to reflect their nerf.
  - balance: Powerators were nerfed and made engineering only. Values for their consumption
      were adjusted all over,  with each company having different maximuns of production,
      powerator efficiency, and taxes. With NT and Tarkon having high taxes and high
      energy rates but having a higher cap of power selling, while the syndicate and
      then dyne paying less taxes or needing less power, at the cost of capping how
      much they can sell, making it so the more effort involved the more credits per
      hour achievable. Details on the PR, but the powerators will give their stats
      on examine.
  - bugfix: Fixed some powerator issues, notably their power not matching to what
      they were set and consuming, made them very customizable with VV and more intuitive
      to use by mappers and admins, players will also find their stats when examining
      instead of having to code dive for this information.
  - qol: Powerator now automatically goes down to the power it has available instead
      of not processing. We are aware this could be a negative if the power is not
      constant, you might want to setup smes units in the middle.
  - rscadd: The portable Gravity Generator, as well as minor tools packs, were made
      accesible by the public at large, instead of just restricted to Engineering.
  - code_imp: Cleaned up the code for Powerators and made it single accounts, as the
      need for two accounts was removed. Can be reverted in the future with ease,
      but for now we save a couple process pass. Updated the Powerator to use proper
      TG procs to make it a lil bit more robust against the passage of time.
  - bugfix: fixed the bug with ghost roles spawned with two of the same first backpack
      item
  - bugfix: fixed the bug with plasmamans not being able to spawn in ghost roles without
      inmediatly inmolating themselves. Cafe Visitor plasmas also start with 3 plasma
      tanks. Cafe Visitors Vox (and primalis!) spawn with 3 nitrogen tanks.
  - balance: Lobstrocities and Explosions will no longer fish up unique items from
      the fishing pools, automation only gets you the baseliine stuff. Fish for the
      actual rewards!
  - balance: Binyat once again can hack fishing portals. It was only a matter of time
      for CODEX to get around its firmware, really.
  - balance: Monocloning jumpercables breed themselves into the Sterile Jumpercables,
      to no one's surprise! (They no longer mate and cannot self reproduce as they
      did in the past, they are still pretty great, just not an AFK exponential swarm
      of free power and money.)
  - rscadd: Adds Two Oversized variants for beds (craft menu, 4/8 cloth and wood),
      an universal, synthetic, variant of the wolf pelt beds (craft menu, 4 leather
      and wood) and liberates the recipe for the thatch bed (craft menu, 4 wood and
      thatch, which is made by putting grass in a dehidratator)
  - rscadd: ID cards now show if they got weapon permits or not on double examine!
  - rscadd: ID cards show if they have weapon permits on the hyperlink of the examine

      sprite to avoid any visual confusion with 'hilberthotel'
  - map: Reduced the various ghost roles powerators from 3 > 1.
  - image: Changed the ghost console sales pads so its more visually distinct from
      the regular civilian pads.
