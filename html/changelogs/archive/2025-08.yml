      with organic limbs.
  - qol: Renamed the surgery "Posibrain Reboot (Revival)" to "Chassis Restoration

  Absolucy, PowerfulBacon:
  - bugfix: Screentip icons work on the latest BYOND 516 again.
  Alexi-6410:
  - rscadd: Following NanoTrasen's recent introduction of stoats on station as a viable
      pest control solution, Central Command has found it fit to relax their customs

      the intergalactic pet trade) through customs as part of their progressive Bring-Your-Pet-To-Work
      initiative.
  Aliceee2ch:
  - bugfix: Fixed things forgotten in walls of Catwalk Station

  - balance: the MEAT backpack (from the MEAT cargo pack) may be a smidge different

      have been replaced with their megacell counterparts.
  - bugfix: .45 rubber bullet casings are now appropriately labeled as rubber bullet

  - rscadd: Citing the reason "Why not" and/or "because we can", Scarborough Arms
      has started to export the DURANDAL 23-E parts/conversion kit, for cannibalizing
      an NT20 into the rC-20 submachine gun. For obvious reasons, this is very much
      against corporate regs, as to do so would imply one would have robbed and/or
      murdered the local Shield unit.
  - rscadd: With the rumors of Scarborough Arms releasing parts kits that require
      cannibalizing NT20s to complete a new gun, Nanotrasen has chosen to release
      spare parts kits for NT20s in the slim chance that a Shield unit has their service
      weapon cannibalized for nefarious deeds.

  - bugfix: Nanotrasen apologizes for issuing its Heads of Security faulty "Volta"
      stunswords that somehow turned invisible when their energy variant was turned
      on. Nanotrasen also would like to remind employees that the new stunswords are
      "Volta" stunswords and not "NT-20 Excalibur" variant stunswords; someone forgot
      to update the memo before initial rollouts occurred.
  - bugfix: Roaches now die properly to bugspray (having a few seconds of life before
      flipping over dramatically and not exploding into paste).
  - rscadd: Haywire bullets create electromagnetic pulse visual effects for the sake

  - balance: .980 Tydhouer grenades now properly cost points in the ammo bench.
  - qol: Having throw mode enabled while racking the slide on a gun has you catch
      the ejected casing. Unless your hands are full, your hands are unprotected and
      the casing is recently fired, or you are clumsy (e.g. a clown), in which case
      you drop the casing and look silly.
  - rscadd: Central Command, in tandem with the Free Trade Union, has discovered a
      concerningly large cache of old paperwork that... really, really needs to be
      filed. For a small deposit, you, too, can dig away at this in return for budget!
  - balance: Further developments to the BR-38 program allowed the designers to expand
      the magazines to 30 rounds (up from 28) and harden the rail system to at least
      prevent degradation for one magazine's worth of fire (30 rounds). Maintenance,
      however, remains an issue.
  - rscadd: The Kolben-Keule enhanced combat shotgun is now in circulation in your
      local deathmatch gun crate. Good luck, Underground Thunderdome participants!
  - balance: Nanotrasen has realized that there's nothing stopping them from shaving
      off a bit more material while manufacturing and reissuing .38 revolvers, allowing
      them to be considered "small" (e.g. fitting in pockets/boxes).
  - balance: New specs for .38 ammunition allows for more propellant to be loaded,
      increasing damage dealt for most ammunition types.

      be inmune to ash storms and use a different armor underneath.

      old resprites of the white/black suit jackets which have since been improved
      drastically. (search: ''Suit Jacket'' in loadout)'
  - balance: added a 'damaged' marine MODsuit with security-grade armor, a bit less
      module complexity, and no admin/antag modules. This has replaced the admin-ERT
